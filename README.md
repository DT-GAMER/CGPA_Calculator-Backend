# CGPA Calculator

The CGPA calculator is a simple web application that allows students to calculate their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on their grades for each course. The application is built with Python and ReactJS.

To use the CGPA calculator, simply go to https://cgpa-calc-rho.vercel.app/ and enter your grades for each course and the corresponding credit load. The calculator will then compute your CGPA for the given semester.

## Grading System

The grading system used by the CGPA calculator is as follows:

- A: 5
- B: 4
- C: 3
- D: 2
- E: 1
- F: 0

## Sample Computation

Here is a sample computation using the CGPA calculator:

Given that Caroline is a 200L student of the Computer Science Department, who is studying the below-mentioned courses for the Rain Semester. Compute her CGPA accordingly.

| Course Title | Course Code | Credit Load | Grade |
|--------------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Introduction to Java Programming | CSC201 | 3 | A |
| Introduction to Systems Programming | CSC202 | 4 | A |
| Mathematical Methods 1 | MTH201 | 3 | B |

CGPA = (3 * 5 + 4 * 5 + 3 * 4) / (3 + 4 + 3) = 4.33
